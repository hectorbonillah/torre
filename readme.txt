The first thing to build the webpage was to think about the front page.

I added a top menu which allows the users to get quickly to each option available.

I also added a carousel to show some tips.

I though about three main functions to include in the page: Search, job listing and genoma.

For the searching part, I implemented the search system through JavaScript.

I totally re-designed the Genoma and the job listing.
